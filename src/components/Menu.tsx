                            (2023-08-17) Previously some data was not pulled to the app if a synchronisation request failed,
                            now the application will retry the request up to 5 times if a request fails.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (2023-08-17) Previously newly entered data could be deleted after a failed sync; this has been
                            resolved.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (2023-08-17) We have improved the synchronisation message system: now the synchronizing message
                            will close only at the end of a sync and there are new animations on the message. The count of not
                            synced data will also show on top of the sync button.
                        </li>

                            (2023-08-07) It was hard to tell exactly how well a new roll-out of bahis-desk had been so we have
                            added the ability to track which version of the desktop app is being used in the field.
                        </li>
                        <li>(2023-06-23) We now how automated semantic versioning for an improved release cycle.</li>
                        <li>
                            (2023-05-25) The Geoinformation and Form Summary pages had no search feature and so were difficult
                            to use - we have added search features to both pages.
                        </li>
                        <li>(2023-03-29) Buitl and released bahis-dash v1!</li>
                        <li>
                            (2023-03-28) When users sign in from bahis-desk they used to have the entire branch catchment
                            returned to them but no upazila (which was later inferred from the whole catchment every time it
                            was needed); we now don&apos;t send the catchment (as users already have this) and do send the
                            upazila (so it no longer needs to be determined over and over again) - importantly this limits
                            login to accounts that have been correctly assigned as an upazila.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (2023-03-22) When forms were being updated, bahis-desk was not recognising this unless the parent
                            module was also updated. This has now been corrected.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (2023-03-21) Previously users were being asked to fill out mouza every time they filled out any
                            form; however, nobody was using this as union is enough granularity and so we have removed this
                            from all forms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (2023-03-07) When synchronising new form submissions, clicking &quot;sync now&quot; twice in a row
                            was creating local duplications due to timestamp discrepancies. In this version, there will be no
                            duplicated entry as we always default to the version kept on the central server.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (2023-02-23) When editing a form that had been submitted but not synchronised, clicking
                            &quot;submit&quot; in the edit window was creating a local duplicate of that submission. In this
                            version, there will be no locally duplicated entries.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (2023-01-24) Previously there was no auto-fill for geolocations (division, district, and upazila),
                            the geolocation fields have been hidden from users, and now it is auto filling in the back.
                        </li>
